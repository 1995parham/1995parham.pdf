\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{2016}{Intern}{Iranian Telecommunication Reseach Center}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborated with three colleagues to design and implement innovative home automation solutions leveraging the Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak.
    \item Utilized our expertise in Ruby programming to effectively maintain and optimize the ThingSpeak platform for seamless integration with our IoT System.
    \item As a resutlt, we were able to achieve significant improvements in home automation performance, efficiency, and functionality.
  \end{itemize}

\cventry{2017--2019}{System Architect}{IoT Working Group of Amirkabir University of Technology}{Tehran, Iran}{}{%
  As a member of a cross-functional team, I contributed to the design and implementation of a high-performance IoT platform using Golang.
  My responsibilities included deploying microservices on bare-metal servers using Docker and monitoring them with Prometheus.
  To orchestrate these services, we utilized Portainer. Working alongside two to three other platform engineers,
  I provided essential API endpoints to the backend team (who utilized PHP) to query sensor data and control actuators.
  As a result, we were able to achieve a scalable platform capable of handling 1K requests per second.
