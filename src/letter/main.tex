I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Developer position at [Company Name],
as advertised on [where you found the job posting]. With a deep passion for coding and a driven mindset to initiate projects efficiently,
I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and help bring value to your projects.

I commenced my programming career at university, where my predilection for backend technologies first took root.
Following this path led me to the IoT Laboratory, where I honed my abilities as a developer and system architect.
While there, I took the initiative to author two distinct IoT platforms using Python and Go, each designed to address divergent requirements and streamline operations.

Subsequently, I transitioned to Snapp!, a premier ride-hailing firm in Iran. Here, my focus shifted to pricing projects,
allowing me to harness Go to construct a robust data pipeline. My responsibilities expanded to include the overhaul of an event dispatching system,
further solidifying my proficiency in Go and event-driven architecture.
This role provided me with extensive experience in cutting-edge technologies including Kubernetes, Docker, EMQ, and RabbitMQ.

I am eager to bring my background in fast-paced development environments and comprehensive understanding of
various backend technologies to [Company Name].
I strive to ensure that projects I’m involved with are completed swiftly and effectively,
prioritizing core requirements and maintaining a tight scope to meet business objectives.

I’m looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of
your development team. Thank you for considering my application.
I am very excited about the prospect of contributing to [Company Name] and am available at your convenience for an interview.
